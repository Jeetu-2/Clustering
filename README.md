# Clustering

Steps :

1. Selecting a dataset from UCI Library and importing it to Google Colab
2. Performing Cluster (K Means + Hierarchial + Birch) analysis
3. Saving the scores from Cluster analysis in table format (in CSV file)

Leanings :

While making a Clustering Model, the most important thing is to select how many numbers of clusters are going to be there. The no. of clusters can change the efficiency of the model and so in order for high efficiency of the model, we should know the correct no. of clusters that should be present. This can be selected in 2 ways, either Elbow plot can be used and the value of k in this plot gives the no. of clusters or silhouette scores of all the clusters can be seen, the clusters with max silhouette score should be taken.
